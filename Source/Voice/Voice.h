/*
 Voice could possibly inherit from juce::AudioProcessor
 I am writing my own class for the following reasons:
    - It will likely be simpler so may be quicker to construct/destruct and may use less memory
    - I may change how I process audio as I go
    - Reading the full class implementation takes time and I'd prefer to start working as this is a learning project
    - I do not know if this would be appropriate without further research
 Benefits to inheriting from juce::AudioProcessor could be:
    - Multiple versions of processBlock()
    - Details such as ProcessingPrecision and Realtime already built in
